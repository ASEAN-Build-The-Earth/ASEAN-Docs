</details>

## ðŸ’¬<small>I can't join the server, why?</small>
<details><summary>Server might be down</summary>

Server is not guaranteed to be online 24/7 as some times it may be under maintenance, please see in our discord server posts for our server status.
</details>

## ðŸ’¬<small>I want to build this place</small>
<details><summary>Become Official builder.</summary>

Due to our [Builder System](./getting-started/builder-system), New builder can only build in [Plot system server](./getting-started/visiting#2-plot-server) 
with limited buildsite to choose, this is to prevent unfinished build laying around in our server and made it hard to organise the build team.

You may also build a BuildTheEarth building by yourself in singleplayer world with [BuildTheEarth Modpack](../guide/modpack) installed but we DO NOT recommended this way as we cannnot review your build properly.
