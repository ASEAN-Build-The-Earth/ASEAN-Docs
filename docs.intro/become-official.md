## Why official builder ?
<Text.Tab>After you started to get the hang of our building system, you will problably get bored and wonder why you can only build at limited location and area. But we still need a way to verify that you're experienced enough to actually building world-wide _(in this case, ASEAN)_ and applying for official builder is the way.</Text.Tab>
