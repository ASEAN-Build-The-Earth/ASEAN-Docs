There's many things to learn at building in bte, you're not even half way through the full builder knowledge here.
We suggest reading our document [Builder Guide](../../../guide/builder-guide) to get the detailed information of it.

To rank up your builder role in ASEAN BTE, you'll have to  complete 3-4 plots
By passing it you'll gain access to our master server and build whatever you want to build!

## Preview building in Singapore Build Server {#preview-building}
We have a specific server for builder building in Singapore region. The server supports vanilla minecraft to the latest 1.18 version.
Type the command `/server sg` and [quick warp](../visiting#quick-warp) to any buildsite in Singapore to visit this server.
