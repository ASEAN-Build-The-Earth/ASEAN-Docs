## Improve your builder skill {#improve-more}
There's many things to learn at building in BTE, you're not even half way through the full builder knowledge here.
We suggest reading our document [Builder Guide](../../../guide/builder-guide) to get into more detailed.

:::info

To rank up your builder role in ASEAN BTE, you'll have to pass our plot system's exam plot.
By passing, you'll gain access to our master server and build whatever you want to build!

More info in [Becoming Official Builder](../../become-official) page

## Preview building in Master Server {#preview-building}
The server supports vanilla minecraft to the latest 1.21 version.
Type the command `/server master` and [quick warp](../visiting#quick-warp) to any available buildsite  to visit this server. 


If you finished 1 or two plot and gained the total point greater than <Text.Hl type="primary">10 points</Text.Hl>, 
ask our staff member in our [discord server](../../get-started#discord) with any available buildsite you want to build on for building permission.
