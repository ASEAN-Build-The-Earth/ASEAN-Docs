title: Getting your plot's location and reference
id: getting-reference
---

When you started new plot the minecraft chat will prompt you your plot location and links in <a href="https://google.com/maps">google map</a> and <a href="https://google.com/earth">google earth</a> as well as <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">open street map</a><br/>
However if you lost the link, you can still get it by typing `/plot links`.

```mdx-code-block

import Styling from '@site/util/styling';
import guide_links from "@site/static/img/docs/finishing-plot/guide_links.gif"

<Styling.MinecraftWindow width="fit-content"><img src={guide_links} width="500rem" alt="Guide Image"/></Styling.MinecraftWindow>

```

For more info about your plot, type out `/plot help` to see available commands.
