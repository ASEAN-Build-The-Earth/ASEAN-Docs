```

Now it's time to start building your plot!<br/>
In this page we'll guide you how you as a beginner can build your plot

## Basic Workflow
### 1. See your building outline
This might be hard but you have to check how your building looks like vs in Minecraft. 

Because of the blocky-ness of minecraft,
It is normal if the outline looks a bit off compared to the real life building. You may be able to re-outline it.

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_0} aspect="1902 616" alt="guild_1_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```

### 2. Build a rough building shell
After you're happy with your building outline, pick a few blocks, it doesn't need to fit your building's color at first. 
Then use those blocks to build a rough shell of your build covering every important point of your build.
:::tip
Some plots may have prebuilt shells so if you have a prebuilt shell, you can skip this step.
:::

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_1} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_1_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```



### 3. Fill up your outlined shell
Choose a block of your choice for building, it has to fit the building color but since minecraft has very few color choices especially with minecraft version 1.12.2. it's fine to choose a color that is close to what minecraft has.<br/>
Then fill the outlined shell with blocks you choosed. 
:::tip
If you already installed BTE modpack, by pressing `g` there will be color block database popup for accurate color Hexcode
:::
```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_2} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_2_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```

### 4. Build assets and decoration
See your in-real-life building, does it have an extra roof extended around? Does it has a garage somewhere? Does it has chimney extended from the roof? 
Then build it! don't miss anything.

:::caution Interiors of houses of the plots are not allowed.
Due to privacy laws in many countries, we are not allowed to build interiors of houses. However, if street view shows the interior, you may build `only` that part.
:::

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_3} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_3_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```

### 5. Polish the build and exterior
The final step is to polish your building<br/>

:::info tip
<details><summary>Try checking this list if you've built everything already</summary>

- [x] Floor's material is correct 
- [x] Tree and bushes
- [x] Gate and doors
- [x] Poles and sheds
- [x] Windows all around the building

</details>

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_4} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_4_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```


:::tip

Don't forget to fill up the inside of all your windows to cover the interior.
```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="30rem"><Img src={GuideWindows} aspect="600 329" alt="guild_windows" /></MinecraftWindow>
```
