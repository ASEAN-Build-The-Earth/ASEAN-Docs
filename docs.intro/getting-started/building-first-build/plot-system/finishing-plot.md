Now its time to start building your plot!<br/>
In this page we'll guide you how yu can build your plot in beginner way

## Basic Workflow
### 1. See your building outline
This might be hard but you have to check how your building looks like vs in minecraft. Because the blockyness of minecraft 
dont be confuse if your plot outline looks off, you can also adjust the outline to fit your real life building better.

```mdx-code-block
<Styling.MinecraftWindow width="fit-content"><Image img={Guide_0} width="750rem" alt="guild_1_image" /></Styling.MinecraftWindow>
```

### 2. Build a rough building shell
After you're good with understanding your build, pick a few block, it doesnt need to fit your building's color at first 
and use those block to build a rough shell of your build covering every important point of your build.

```mdx-code-block
<Styling.MinecraftWindow width="fit-content"><Image img={Guide_1} width="750rem" alt="guild_1_image" /></Styling.MinecraftWindow>
```

### 3. Fill up your outlined shell
Choose a block choice of your for building, it has to fit the building color but since minecraft has very few color choice especially with minecraft version 1.12.2 we only supports. its fine to bend your color with closet minecraft has.<br/>
Then fill the outlined shell with blocks you choosed. 

```mdx-code-block
<Styling.MinecraftWindow width="fit-content"><Image img={Guide_2} width="750rem" alt="guild_2_image" /></Styling.MinecraftWindow>
```

### 4. Build assets and decoration
See your in-real-life build, see around it does it has extra roof extended around? does it has a garage somewhere? does it has chimney extended from the roof? 
then build it! dont miss anything.

:::caution you dont have to build cars or interior of the build
however if you feels like to build it, go ahead but we don't encouraged

```mdx-code-block
<Styling.MinecraftWindow width="fit-content"><Image img={Guide_3} width="750rem" alt="guild_3_image" /></Styling.MinecraftWindow>
```

### 5. Polish the build and exterior
Last final step is to polish out your build<br/>
