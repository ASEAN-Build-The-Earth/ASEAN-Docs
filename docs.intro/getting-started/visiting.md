After joining our server, We currently have two main servers which are available for visitors.
## 1. Master Server
This is the main server where our Official Builders use to build the Earth.
You can visit our build sites such as `Kuala Lumpur`, `Bangkok`, `Ho Chi Minh`, `Jakarta, Manila`, `Singapore`,... here.

:::danger Bedrock Edition is not supported in the master server
This is because we have a mod called `Cubic Chunks` in our master server that extends the world height to infinity. The mod exists only in Java edition.
:::

:::caution Use the modpack provided to visit master server
Because of the mod that we have mentioned above, it affects all Minecraft versions which are not on 1.12.2. <br/>
If you continue connecting to the master server with newer Minecraft versions, 
you may get long rendering time and weird chunk loading. 
You will not receive any support regarding this.
:::

### Joining Master server
You can simply type the command `/server master` to connect to this server.

### To visit what we have built
  #### Quick warp
  > - Type the command `/warp` and a <kbd>space</kbd>.<br/>
  > - Pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> to see available warps.
  > - By running this command, you will be warped to a location assigned to this warp.
