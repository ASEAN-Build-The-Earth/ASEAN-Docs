As you can see in the previous page that the exam plot is auto generated by Build the earth terrain data 
which is the data from [Open street map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). 
Unfortunately the terrain data is not perfect and many building outline is left out as blank area. 
We will be using [World Edit](./world-edit) with Build the earth custom command to recreate the building and roads outline.

:::caution
before you follow though this page, please make sure you already cleared your terrain with world edit. 
If you haven't, go back [here](./world-edit#clearing-terrain) and do it first.

## Tpll
Tpll is a Build the earth command to teleport yourself to a specific real-world geographic coordinates in minecraft.
We can use this command to accurately mark out building's coordinate by satellite image to minecraft.<br/>
In this example we will use [google map](https://www.google.com/maps) to mark it out

### Marking points with tpll
> 1. Go your plot in [google.com/map](https://www.google.com/maps) <small>(`/plot link` to get your plot location)</small>.
> 2. Finds noticeable pivot points of building/scenery you wanted to mark.
> 3. Hover your cursor there and <kbd>Right-Click</kbd>, a popup window will pop up with geographic coordinate.
> Click it and the coordinate should be copied to your clipboard.
> 4. Go back to minecraft and type in command `/tpll` followed by the clipboard you copied.<br/>
> <small>( <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste the clipboard in minecraft chat)</small>
> 5. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and you will be teloported to the point you copied.
> 6. Don't move around yet and place a block right where you are standing to mark out the tpll-ed point.
> 7. Repeat marking pivot anytime you want and we will connect it together in the next section.

## Conecting Marker
We will be using [World Edit](./world-edit) command to connect the marker up.
> But first you need to know about block ids.<br/>
> ### Block ID
> * Block ID is a code-name of blocks, the name will be use as block name in command's parameter
> * By default you cannot see block ids, press <kbd>F3</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to enable it.
> * Now, when you hover your cursor over any block in inventory you should see number formatted name behind the actual name of item
> ### Using Block ID
> * For example when you read the number formatted id, you see  `(#0035/4)`
> * In World Edit command, we will use `35:4` as the block id
>
> :::tip
> In our plot server, we also support snake-case id. The id can be see in form of `minecraft:block_name`
> , you can use `block_name` for the block id sraight ahead.

### `//line` [`Block ID`](./making-outline#block-id)
`//line` is a world edit command to create a straight line out of 2 positions
* Select first position with your wand. ( <kbd>Left-Click</kbd> )
* Select second position ( <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> )
* type the command `//line` followed by [Block ID](./making-outline#block-id) you wanted to make a line with.
* A straight line will then be inserted from first position to second position you selected.

## Roads
We prefer the gray concrete powder block for roads in ASEAN Team.
To select a selection for setting roads, we will use `//sel poly` command.<br/>

### Setting roads with `//sel poly`
`//sel poly` command will change wand selection mode to polygon,<br/> you can now select first position with <kbd>Left-Click</kbd>
then <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> position 2, 3, 4, ... to create polygon selection.
> * `//sel poly` to enter polygon selection.
> * Select first position of your road with <kbd>Left-Click</kbd>.
> * <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> Next position and repeat until you circled the whole road.
> * Try using command like `//set 252:7`, it will set the selected polygon to block ID of  `252:7` which is gray concrete powder block.
>
> :::tip
> You can use command like `//replace grass 252:7`which will replace all grass block in selected polygon to gray concrete powder.
