As you can see in the previous page, the exam plot is auto-generated by Build the Earth terrain data, which comes from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

Unfortunately, terrain data is not always accurate to real-life scale, so I highly recommend using Google Earth Pro for better precision.

We will be using [WorldEdit](./world-edit) with Build the Earth custom commands to create building and road outlines.

## Tpll

Tpll is a Build the Earth command that teleports you to specific real-world geographic coordinates in Minecraft.
We can use this command to accurately mark out building coordinates using satellite images.<br/>
In this example, we will use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) to mark out the points.

### Marking Points with Tpll

> 1. Go to your plot in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) <small>(`/plot link` to get your plot location)</small>.
> 2. Find noticeable pivot points (corners) of your building or scenery that you want to mark.
> 3. Hover your cursor over the point, and <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> to open a popup with the geographic coordinates.
>    Click the coordinates to copy them to your clipboard.
> 4. Go back to Minecraft and type in the command `/tpll` followed by the coordinates you copied.<br/> <small>(Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste the clipboard in Minecraft chat)</small>
> 5. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to teleport to the copied point.
> 6. Do not move yet—place a block where you are standing to mark the point.
> 7. Repeat this for all desired points, and in the next section, you will learn how to connect them.

## Connecting Markers

We will use [WorldEdit](./world-edit) commands to connect the markers.

> Before proceeding, it's important to understand the concept of block names.<br/>
>
> ### Block Names
>
> * Block names are used to refer to blocks in commands.
> * For example, instead of using a block ID like `35:4`, you would now use the block name `minecraft:stone_bricks`.
> * By default, Minecraft now uses block names in the format `minecraft:block_name`, such as `minecraft:cobblestone`.

### `//line` [`Block Name`](./making-outline#block-name)

`//line` is a WorldEdit command that creates a straight line between two positions.

* Select the first position with your wand (<kbd>Left-Click</kbd>).
* Select the second position (<kbd>Right-Click</kbd>).
* Type the command `//line` followed by the block name you want to use for the line (e.g., `minecraft:stone`).
* A straight line will be created from the first to the second position.

</MinecraftWindow>
```

## Roads

The ASEAN Team prefers using the `minecraft:gray_concrete_powder` block for roads.
To select the road area, we will use the `//sel poly` command.

### Setting Roads with `//sel poly`

This command changes your wand's selection mode to polygon.<br/>
You can now select the first position with <kbd>Left-Click</kbd>, then use <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> for the next points to create a polygon selection.

> * Type `//sel poly` to enter polygon selection mode.
> * Select the first position of your road with <kbd>Left-Click</kbd>.
> * <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> subsequent positions to create the road selection.
> * After completing the selection, use a command like `//set minecraft:gray_concrete_powder` to set the area to gray concrete powder.
>
> - Type `//sel cuboid` to switch back to cuboid selection mode.
