Welcome! If you're reading this, you're now a builder. Here's what you need to do to get started.
### 📍 Step 1: Choose Your Build Site

* **Find a location** inside the [build site boundaries](https://map.thatsnek.asia/#world:122564:0:-115800:1500:0:0:0:1:flat). The red squares on the map mark the areas.
* **Outside the boundaries** is okay for your first build, but **get approval from the support bot** first if you want to go beyond the red squares.
* This rule applies to every build, including future ones.

### 🚀 Step 2: Create Your Warp

To set up a warp to your build site, run:
`/setwarp <name>`

#### Warp Naming Rules:

* Use **2-letter country codes** in lowercase (e.g., `sg` for Singapore, `th` for Thailand).
  **Exception:** Cambodia uses `cam` instead of `kh`.
* Use **PascalCase** for multi-word names (e.g., `JoeMama`).
* For single-word names like `sg` or `north`, PascalCase is not needed.

To hide a warp from the menu and webmap, add `!` at the start.
Example: `/warp !kfcVN`

### Warp Format

**For most countries:**
`/warp {country},{state/province/city},{subDistrict},{warpName}`
Example: `/warp th,bangkok,khlongsan,iconsiam`

**For Singapore:**
`/warp sg,{district/area},{warpName}`
Example: `/warp sg,AngMoKio,SomeShop`

### 🏗️ Step 3: Start Building

1. **Terraform:** Shape the land to your needs.
2. **Outline:** Plan your layout and structure locations.
3. **Build:** Start constructing the structures.

That's it! Once these steps are done, you’ll be on your way to building your first site.
