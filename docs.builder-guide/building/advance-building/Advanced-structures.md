## Interior design
:::warning
For most buildings, do not build interiors of private areas, unless it is known to many people.
:::
:::info Requires:
  - Drawing of parallel lines
  - //line
  - //stack

These may be the requirements for interiors.
  1. Getting the blueprint/floor plan 
  2. Getting images of the area
  3. Aligning the image the correct way.
  
For interior design, you are required to detail it as much as you can. This is so the area does not fill dead.
