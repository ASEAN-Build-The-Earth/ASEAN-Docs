I'll have to assume that you have read through `Colors` already.

## Block sizes
![Blockexample](@site/static/media/docs/builder-guide/headSizes.png)
Block sizes can vary depending on what is shown in street view.

Typically, you may use a full block for it.

However, there are certain parts, such as street lamps, that are smaller than 1 block squared in length. 

You may use mods included in this server such as Head Database and Banner Maker. Here is an example of a block 1m by 1m:

Heads can be considered half-blocks. Do note that it must be exactly the same location as indicated in street view. They can be used for things such as street lights, baskets and other smaller details.

:::caution
If no colors match up to any smaller blocks, you can use a full block.

:::info Tl;dr
- Choose smaller blocks for finer details

## Limits of detailing and overdetailing
Overdetailing is when one building has too much excessive detail. Such buildings will not be good to look at; as there are way too many things in the way.

It is the same concept as bodybuilding; too much excessive muscle and the athelete looks more like a demon.

## Big banners
Big banners require good color selection basics. They are like pixel art; but instead of hard lights it shows soft shadows.

:::warning
Banner maker mod does not create big banners well as they despawn after a certain range. (Simulation Range)

## Windows
Generally speaking, you have to layer windows so that it fits the image.

You may use [BTE Detailing Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gt8loTr0mIzT2-ACL82F851R4VaPOVlCDQ2ih45RTrU/edit) as reference. 

For example, for thin panels, you may choose to use end rods, half doors or trapdoors, depending on which is the best fit.

## Head Database

![HDBUI](@site/static/media/docs/builder-guide/headDB.PNG)

Head Database is one of our mods (not found in singapore server), which is used to search up head IDs.

The command to look up head database is /hdb.

:::info
It is not Housing and Development Board.

## Banner Maker
![ui](@site/static/media/docs/builder-guide/bannerMakerUI.png)
Banner Maker is a mod that allows you to create banners visually and save them for later use.

It has the same function as a loom.

:::tip This mod can save you time because:
  - You do not need to find all the dyes in the creative inventory.
  - If anything goes wrong, there is an undo button.
  - You do need to memorize/search up banner patterns.
