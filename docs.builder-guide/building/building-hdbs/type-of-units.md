# Types of HDB units

For this guide, we will only be focusing on 3 major types. HDB units will always contain the standard apartment rooms, such as bedrooms and kitchen. The following is a standardized way to build windows for the bedrooms and living rooms, which is very, very typical for a lot of HDBs.

## 3-room

## 4-room

## 5-room


:::caution Quick reminder
If a window is 2 blocks wide at zero degrees angle, it will be 1 block wide at 45 degrees angle.
