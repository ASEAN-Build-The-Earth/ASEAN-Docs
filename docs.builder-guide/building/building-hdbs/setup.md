# Setup

First, we need to setup our environment. This guide uses Fabric client mods to improve the building experience. You can install them in either 1.18-1.20 Minecraft versions. The Prism Launcher for Minecraft allows for an easier installation.

- **Fabric API** - A core mod required to run Fabric mods

- **Sodium** - Improves performance

- **Lithium** - Improves performance

- **Phospor** - Improves performance

- **Xaero's Minimap** - Allows you to view the world map at the top left corner.

- **Xaero's World Map** - Allows you to view the world map fullscreen. This is very useful to check progress and identify angled buildings.

- **WorldEdit** - While the BTE ASEAN server comes with WorldEdit, it is included here so it can also be tested on singleplayer.

- **WorldEditCUI** - A way to visually see selected regions.

- **Distant Horizons** - Allows you to view the world with a much larger render distance.
