# Terminology

:::caution Quick reminder
This guide is only for building multiple storey HDB flats in the Singapore region. It may also apply for general apartments, but this guide focuses on Singapore's public housing.

Before we start, we need to familiarize with the following definitions first.

- **Unit** - A single house unit

- **Corridor** - A long passage in a building.

- **Floor** - A group of units as part of a floor. Will always have a lift lobby and staircase. In rare cases, some floors are what's called 'sky gardens'.

- **Flat**: - A single HDB residential building. 

- **Project**: - A group of flats built together as part of a development. It often include carparks, playgrounds and gardens. For example, Punggol Regalia and Parc Meadow @ Tengah.

- **Town/Estate**: - Planned communities in Singapore. Usually a subset of planning area. These usually contain many HDB projects, MRT stations, shopping malls and other amenities. Examples, Sengkang New Town, Woodlands New Town, Bidadari Estate.

- **Planning Area**: - Urban planning divisions in Singapore. For example, Tampines planning area, Lim Chu Kang planning area.

- **Angle**: - Degree of slope for a line. Commonly known as diagonal in Minecraft. In this guide, you will keep seeing numbers like `1 2 1 2 1 2`. This represents the line pattern for the angle, which in this case refers to the 33 deg in the image below (Step 2 then 1 block).
