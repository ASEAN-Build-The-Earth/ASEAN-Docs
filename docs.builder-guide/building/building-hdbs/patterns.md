# Patterns

Building HDB flats in Minecraft is not as difficult as it seems. Identifying patterns helps to accelerate the progress of your builds. Here are patterns you need to look out for.

## Parallelism

Even though majority of BuildTheEarth's projection is angled, you can still find many buildings to be parallel to each other. In the case of HDBs, some flats under a project follow the same line. This means once you are able to draw a line for one flat, you can reference that line to build other flats that are parallel to it.

To do so, you need to `/tpll` at 2 points of a flat which creates a line. Adjust it slightly and it can then be referenced. The example below shows a group of flats at Yew Tee.

## Duplicates

Some HDB flats are straight up identical to each other, so it can be easily copied. In some cases you may need to flip or rotate it. Rarely you may need to modify it slightly as the unit type may vary. You need to ensure the floor plan and number of windows match what you see IRL or Google Maps.

## Standardization

For all HDB flats, each floor is 2 blocks high with 1 block in between. Window heights can either be 1 or 2 blocks height depending on how it looks IRL or Google Maps. For how wide windows are, you can refer to the previous page.
