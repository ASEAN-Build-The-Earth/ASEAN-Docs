---

You can teleport to any location in the world using the command <kbd>/tpll x z y</kbd>, for example <kbd>/tpll 40.708838, -73.999225</kbd> to go to New York.

To get the coordinates of any place in the world you can:
- Copy them from the [Interactive Map](https://buildtheearth.net/map).
- Go to Google maps, right-click onto your point of interest and click on the numbers.

:::tip
There is also a custom mod that has been made for this project only made by `Smyler#7078`, called [`Terramap`](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terramap). 

This mod allows you to teleport to any place without opening any external software.

After it is installed in your modpack, you can open the map with <kbd>M</kbd>, and then zoom in on the location you want to go to.
