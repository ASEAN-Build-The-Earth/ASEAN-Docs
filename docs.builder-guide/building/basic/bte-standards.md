## Diagonal building

</summary>
BTE introduces a new concept called Diagonal Building.

Diagonal building, in simple terms, is building (mostly) not on right angles. It is a cocept mostly unique to BTE because 

1. It is a lot easier to build on right angles than on diagonals

2. Most of the buildings in BTE are not parallel to one another

## Distortion

![distortion](@site/static/media/docs/builder-guide/dymaxion_distortion.PNG)
Shows height adjustment after projection of a sphere (the earth) into a flat plane.

Distortion in BTE only happens in the verical (y) axis. 

Every ring in the picture above adds 0.1m to the distortion.

Luckily, our area has almost no distortion.

## Interiors

![detailedInterior](@site/static/media/docs/builder-guide/parkroyalInterior.png)
### Allowed Areas
- Can be built on a public area
- Cannot be built on a private areas

### Data & Estimation
Interiors generally do not contain data which can be found in Google Maps.

It has to be accurate like the BTE Building.

:::tip
Its not advisable to build interiors of any building unless you know how to find the correct shape of it.
