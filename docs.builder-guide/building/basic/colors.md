## Color selection

![Minecraftcomparion](@site/static/media/docs/builder-guide/minecraftcomparison.png)
Color selection, in BTE sense, is picking the closest color to what it looks like in real life. 

For example, if the exterior is made of glass, you have to make the exterior of your minecraft build out of glass.

:::tip
You may use google maps and go to street view to find out the exact colors.
:::

:::caution Things you may encounter:
  - Hard highlights/shadows
  - No color matching a block(especially light blue)

## Noisy colors

Noisy colors is a pattern of noise, and can be made with //replace [(an array of) block] [block]

It is not recommended as while it can look okay from far away, for street view it will look disgusting.
:::info Tl;dr
Use gradients.

## Gradients

Gradients (in minecraft case) involves stepping a color from one block to another.

You may use [HueBlocks](https://1280px.github.io/hueblocks/) to generate a gradient or a color if you do not know the closest color.
:::tip
- Follow the direction 
- Make the gradient smoooth (no random mixing)

## Final rendering
  For final rendering, you have to make sure the image is of good quality. 
You may: 

- Render in game

- Render in external software
![softwareRender](@site/static/media/docs/builder-guide/singapore_renders.png)

:::caution Make sure:
  
- It looks nice

- Lighting is correct

- Main point is the building

- Background is not empty

## Old textures

:::info

:::
For 1.12.2 users (the majority), you can update your textures with a mod such as [this](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/updated-default-1-12/) (not tested yet). It will help synchronize the textures to newer ones.

BTE in the end will be updated for the latest version.
