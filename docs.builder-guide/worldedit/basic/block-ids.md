title: How to find Block IDs
---

For many WorldEdit commands, you can use Block IDs to reference specific block types.
To show the block IDs in the Minecraft creative menu press <kbd>F3 + H</kbd>. IDs will be shown as 0001/2. This translates to WorldEdit as 1:2 or visit [`Minecraft Block ID reference`](https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/) to see all block IDs.
