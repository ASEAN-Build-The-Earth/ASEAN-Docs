## 💬 <small>Does this server require a modpack?</small>

<details>
  <summary>Plot & Singapore server: No</summary>
  
  Plot & Singapore servers are both hosted for vanilla clients, so no modpack is required.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Master Server: Yes</summary>
  
  Master server is hosted on the Modpack because of the build limit, so it is strongly recommended to get the Modpack instead of only Cubic Chunks.
</details>

## 💬 <small>Is Bedrock edition supported?</small>

<details>
  <summary>Yes!</summary>
  
  Bedrock edition is supported but only on the [Plot system server](./getting-started/visiting#2-plot-server).
</details>

## 💬 <small>What's the server version?</small>

For Singapore:

<details>
  <summary>Java version 1.18.2</summary>
  
  Singapore server is hosted on a vanilla version (Technically Purpur), so it can be updated to newer versions if possible.
</details>

For other countries:

<details>
  <summary>Java version 1.12.2</summary>
  
  Due to one of our mods (Cubic Chunks), which allows building above Minecraft's default height limit (256 blocks), our other servers are on 1.12.2.
</details>

Bedrock version:

<details>
  <summary>Latest</summary>
  
  Bedrock server automatically gets updated to the latest version. Note that Bedrock version only supports the Plot system server.
</details>

## 💬 <small>Where can I contact staff?</small>

<details>
  <summary>Discord server</summary>
  
  Please create a ticket in our Discord server to contact staff or moderators if you have any questions.
</details>

## 💬 <small>I can't join the server, why?</small>

<details>
  <summary>Server might be down</summary>
  
  Server is not guaranteed to be online 24/7. Sometimes it may be under maintenance. Please check our Discord server posts for server status updates.
</details>

## 💬 <small>I want to build this place</small>

<details>
  <summary>Become an official builder</summary>
  
  Due to our [Builder System](./getting-started/builder-system), new builders can only build in the [Plot system server](./getting-started/visiting#2-plot-server) with limited build sites to choose from. This prevents unfinished builds from cluttering the server and keeps the build team organized.
  
  You may also build a BuildTheEarth building by yourself in a singleplayer world with [BuildTheEarth Modpack](../guide/modpack) installed, but we **do not recommend** this method, as we cannot properly review your build.
