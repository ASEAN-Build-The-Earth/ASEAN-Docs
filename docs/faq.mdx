## 💬 <small>Does this server require a modpack?</small>

<details>
  <summary>Plot & Singapore server: No</summary>
  
  Plot & Singapore servers are both hosted for vanilla clients, so no modpack is required.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Master Server: Yes</summary>
  
  Master server is hosted on the Modpack because of the build limit, so it is strongly recommended to get the Modpack instead of only Cubic Chunks.

## 💬 <small>I want to build this place</small>

<details>
  <summary>Become an official builder</summary>
  
  Due to our [Builder System](./getting-started/builder-system), new builders can only build in the [Plot system server](./getting-started/visiting#2-plot-server) with limited build sites to choose from. This prevents unfinished builds from cluttering the server and keeps the build team organized.
  
  You may also build a BuildTheEarth building by yourself in a singleplayer world with [BuildTheEarth Modpack](../guide/modpack) installed, but we **do not recommend** this method, as we cannot properly review your build.
