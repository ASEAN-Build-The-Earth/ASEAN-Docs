<details><summary>No</summary>

However we do have BTE [modpack](../guide/modpack) for [Official Builder](./getting-started/builder-system#official-builder) only.<br/>
But you can install it too if you want to build in BuildTheEarth singleplayer (Not recommended).

</details>

## ðŸ’¬<small>I want to build this place</small>
<details><summary>Become Official builder</summary>

Due to our [Builder System](./getting-started/builder-system), New builder can only build in [Plot system server](./getting-started/visiting#2-plot-server) 
with limited buildsite to choose, this is to prevent unfinished build laying around in our server and made it hard to organise the build team.

You can also build a BuildTheEarth building your self in singleplayer world with [BuildTheEarth Modpack](../guide/modpack) installed but we do not recommended this way because we can't be sure and review if you are building the correct way or not.
