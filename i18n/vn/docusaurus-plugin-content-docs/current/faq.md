## ðŸ’¬<small>Does this server require modpack?</small>
<details><summary>No but it is recommended for better performance</summary>

However we do have BTE [modpack](../guide/modpack) for [Official Builder](./getting-started/builder-system#official-builder) only.<br/>
But you can install it too if you want to build in BuildTheEarth singleplayer (Not recommended).
</details>

## ðŸ’¬<small>Does bedrock edition supported?</small>
<details><summary>Yes!</summary>

Bedrock edition is supported but only in [Plot system server](./getting-started/visiting#2-plot-server) 
</details>

## ðŸ’¬<small>What's the server version?</small>
<details><summary>Java edition Vanilla 1.12.2 - 1.18.1</summary>

## ðŸ’¬<small>Where can i contact staffs?</small>
<details><summary>Discord server</summary>

</details>

## ðŸ’¬<small>I can't join the server, why?</small>
<details><summary>Server might be down</summary>

Server is not guaranteed to be online 24/7 as some times it may be under maintenance, please see in our discord server posts for our server status.
</details>

## ðŸ’¬<small>I want to build this place</small>
<details><summary>Become Official builder</summary>

Due to our [Builder System](./getting-started/builder-system), New builder can only build in [Plot system server](./getting-started/visiting#2-plot-server) 
with limited buildsite to choose, this is to prevent unfinished build laying around in our server and made it hard to organise the build team.

You may also build a BuildTheEarth building by yourself in singleplayer world with [BuildTheEarth Modpack](../guide/modpack) installed but we DO NOT recommended this way as we cannnot review your build properly.
