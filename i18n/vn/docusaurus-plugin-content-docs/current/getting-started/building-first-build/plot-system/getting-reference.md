title: Getting your plot's location and reference
id: getting-reference
---

When you start a new plot, the minecraft chat will display your plot location and related links in [google map](https://google.com/maps) and [google earth](https://google.com/earth) as well as [open street map](https://www.openstreetmap.org).<br/>
However if you lost the link, you can still get it by typing `/plot links`.

```mdx-code-block

import Img from '@site/src/components/Img';
import MinecraftWindow from '@site/src/components/MinecraftWindow';
import guide_links from "@site/static/img/docs/finishing-plot/guide_links.gif"

<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="600px">
    <Img src={guide_links} width="600" height="327" alt="Guide Image"/>
</MinecraftWindow>

```

For more info about your plot, type out `/plot help` to see available commands.
