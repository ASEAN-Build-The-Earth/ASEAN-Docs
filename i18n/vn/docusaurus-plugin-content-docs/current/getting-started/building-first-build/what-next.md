## Improve your builder skill {#improve-more}
There's many things to learn at building in bte, you're not even half way through the full builder knowledge here.
We suggest reading our document [Builder Guide](../../../guide/builder-guide) to get the detailed information of it.

To rank up your builder role in ASEAN BTE, you'll have to pass our plot system's exam plot.
By passing it you'll gain access to our master server and build whatever you want to build!
