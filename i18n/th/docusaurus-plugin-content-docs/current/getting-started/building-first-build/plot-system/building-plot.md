```

Now it's time to start building your plot!<br/>
In this page we'll guide you how you as a beginner can build your plot

## Basic Workflow
### 1. See your building outline
This might be hard but you have to check how your building looks like vs in minecraft. Because of the blocky-ness of minecraft.
It is normal if the outline looks a bit off compared to the real life building. 

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_0} aspect="1902 616" alt="guild_1_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```

### 2. Build a rough building shell
After you're happy with your building outline, pick a few blocks, it doesn't need to fit your building's color at first 
then use those blocks to build a rough shell of your build covering every important point of your build.
:::tip
Some plots may have prebuilt shells so if you have a prebuilt shell you can skip this step.
:::

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_1} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_1_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```



### 3. Fill up your outlined shell
Choose a block of your choice for building, it has to fit the building color but since minecraft has very few color choices especially with minecraft version 1.12.2. it's fine to choose a color that is close to what minecraft has.<br/>
Then fill the outlined shell with blocks you choosed. 

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_2} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_2_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```

### 4. Build assets and decoration
See your in-real-life building, does it have an extra roof extended around? Does it has a garage somewhere? Does it has chimney extended from the roof? 
Then build it! don't miss anything.

:::caution You must not build interior of houses.
Due to laws of many country's we are not allowed to map private property that being Houses, Schools, Government buildings etcetera. 
:::

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_3} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_3_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```

### 5. Polish the build and exterior
The final step is to polish your building<br/>

:::info tip
<details><summary>try checking this list if you've built everything already</summary>

- [x] Floor's material is correct 
- [x] Tree and bushes
- [x] Gate and doors
- [x] Poles and sheds
- [x] Windows all around the building

</details>

```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="53rem"><Img src={Guide_4} aspect="1920 1080" alt="guild_4_image" /></MinecraftWindow>
```


:::info

Don't forget to fill up the inside of all your windows with any dark block you want.
```mdx-code-block
<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="30rem"><Img src={GuideWindows} aspect="600 329" alt="guild_windows" /></MinecraftWindow>
```
