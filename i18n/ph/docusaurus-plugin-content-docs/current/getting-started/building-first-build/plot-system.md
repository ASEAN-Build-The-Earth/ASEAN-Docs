<!-- Brief Intro -->
As we introduced before we have a server dedicated for newcomer to try building their first build called <em style={{color:"var(--ifm-link-color)"}}>Plot System</em>,<br/>
Continue to the next page to get started on it.

<!-- Main Topic -->
## What is Plot System ?
<Text.Tab/>Plot system is a BuildTheEarth Building system made for newcomer and beginner builders to try out building.<br/>
Builders entering the server will have an option to build on any build site created by official builders.<br/><br/>
<details><summary>What is a Build Site ?</summary>

Build site is an on-going team project in every country we're building on(ASEAN).<br/>
The plot's buildsite is originally outlined in the [Master server](../visiting#1-master-server) and submitted to [Plot server](../visiting#2-plot-server) for everyone to build on.

:::info our buildsite at Malaysia, Klang
<dt><sup>This buildsite is registered in the plot system too!</sup></dt>

## Overview
<Text.Tab>Each plot given to builder is a floating island looking land with an outline of the main building in the plot.
The outline is a rough representation of the building's shell by [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/) satellite image for builder to build on top of it.

- Now let's see the workflow from creating your plot to submitting your first BuildTheEarth build via plot system!
