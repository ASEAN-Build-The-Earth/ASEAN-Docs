Everybody has their own way to go about starting a build, however, there are some preparations that will help in the long run, especially in less densely populated areas.
1. Make sure that your plot is not already claimed.
2. <kbd>/tpll</kbd> to your coordinates and have a look around the plot to see the layout, orientation and identify missing features. To find the corners of your plot go to <code>MyBuildTheEarth</code> the webpage and click on your region. You will find the x and y coordinates of the corners there.
3. Go to [`OpenStreetMaps (OSM)`](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and check if your area has been mapped completely and accurately.

   <u>If the mapping is not correct:</u> 

   - Create an account and edit the map on OSM
   - Give the changes 30-60 min to update
   - Select your plot using the WorldEdit <kbd>//wand</kbd> and use <kbd>//regen</kbd> to update

4. Fix your biomes if needed:
    - Select your plot using the WorldEdit <kbd>//wand</kbd>
    - <kbd>//setbiome [biometype]</kbd>, check <kbd>//biomelist</kbd> for all possible biomes
5. Check the elevation of your plot and fix it with WorldEdit.
6. Fix any bugged terrain generation using WorldEdit
7. Do a couple of commands to change some gamerules. These commands are really sensitive to capital letters, so copying them into your game is the safest way to go. Even if you type without capitals, it will show a message that you have done it, even if nothing has changed.

    * <kbd>/gamerule doDaylightCycle false</kbd> (Stops day night cycle)

        - You can then do <kbd>/time set day</kbd> or <kbd>/time set night</kbd> to change the time.

    * <kbd>/gamerule doMobSpawning false</kbd> (Stops mobs from spawning)

        - Doing <kbd>/butcher</kbd> will butcher every mob in the area, including NPC and pets. You can also do <kbd>/kill @e[type=!player]</kbd>.

    * <kbd>/gamerule mobGriefing false</kbd> (Stops creepers/endermen from destroying your build)
    * <kbd>/gamerule doWeatherCycle false</kbd> (Stops rain and snowfall)
    * <kbd>/gamerule randomtickspeed 0</kbd> (Based on theoric knowledge but may not improve the game experience)

        - You can also do <kbd>/weather clear</kbd> to put the weather to sunny. There is also rain and thunderstorm.

:::tip
We recommend to set the chunk loading distance as low as possible (Otherwise the world file size will increase.)
