After joining our server, currently we have 2 main server to visit.
## 1. Master Server
This is the main server where our, Official Builders use to build the earth.
You can visit our build sites such as Malaysia-kuralumpur, Bankok-Thailand here.
:::danger Bedrock Edition is unsupported in the master server

This is because in our master server, we have a mod (Cubic Chunks) that extends the world height hence bedrock edition is unsupported.

:::
:::caution Minecraft above version 1.12.2 is NOT recommended for this server

Because of the mod we talked aboutabove, it affects all minecraft versisons that are not 1.12.2<br/>
If you continue to visit with those newer versions you may get a long rendering times and weird chunk loading. 
You will not recive any support regarding this.
