title: Getting your plot's location and reference
id: getting-reference
---

When you start a new plot, the minecraft chat will display your plot location and related links from [Google Maps](https://google.com/maps) and [Google Earth](https://google.com/earth) as well as [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org).<br/>
However if you lost the link, you can still get it by typing `/plot links`.

```mdx-code-block

import Img from '@site/src/components/Img';
import MinecraftWindow from '@site/src/components/MinecraftWindow';
import guide_links from "@site/static/media/docs/intro/plot-system/building-plot/guide_links.gif"

<MinecraftWindow maxWidth="600px">
    <Img src={guide_links} aspect="600 327" alt="Guide Image"/>
</MinecraftWindow>

```

For more info about your plot, type out `/plot help` to see available commands.
